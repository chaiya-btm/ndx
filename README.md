# 🧭 NDX — The Universal Document Index

> **NDX** is the next-generation document format — designed for both **humans and AI**.  
> A universal, intelligent, and interoperable alternative to PDF — built for the age of connected knowledge.

---

## 🌍 Overview

NDX (short for **"Next Document eXchange"**) redefines how digital documents are created, stored, and understood.  
It goes beyond static layouts by embedding **semantic meaning, metadata, and data structure** directly into the file.  
NDX can be read by humans like a normal document, and by AI systems as structured knowledge.

**In short:**  
> PDF is for printing.  
> NDX is for thinking.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 AI-Native Format** – Documents that are readable, indexable, and interpretable by AI and LLMs.  
- **🔗 Structured Data** – Supports embedded JSON, XML, or schema-linked data inside the document.  
- **📄 Human-Friendly Design** – Retains readability, layout, and visual quality for users.  
- **⚡ Extensible Framework** – Can be parsed and rendered on web, desktop, or POS/ERP systems.  
- **🔒 Secure and Verifiable** – Supports digital signatures, versioning, and traceable metadata.  
- **🌐 Interoperability First** – Integrates seamlessly with existing systems, APIs, and open standards.

## 🧠 Why NDX?

NDX isn’t just a file format.  
It’s a **knowledge vessel** — bridging human-readable layout and machine-readable logic.  
Where PDF froze documents in time, NDX lets them **evolve**, interact, and connect.
